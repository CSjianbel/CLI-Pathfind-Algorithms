# CLI Pathfind Algorithms
 
Command Line Program implementation of different Search algorithms in C.<br />
Namely A*, Depth First Search and lastly Breadth First Search.<br />
Recreating the List Data Structure to utilize for the algorithms.<br /> 

## Clone
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/CSjianbel/CLI-Pathfind-Algorithms.git"
```

## Build

Unix Based Systems:
```bash
make pathfind
```

Windows: 
```
gcc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -c -o assets/List.o src/List/List.c
gcc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -c -o assets/pathfind.o src/pathfind.c
gcc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -c -o assets/main.o src/main.c
gcc -O3 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -o pathfind assets/main.o assets/pathfind.o assets/List.o -lm
```

## Usage
```bash
./pathfind [Pathing] [Algorithm] [Board]

./pathfind [-a, -d] [-a, -d, -b] [structure.txt]

./pathfind -a -d src/Boards/test1.txt

./pathfind -d src/Boards/test2.txt

./pathfind src/Boards/test3.txt
```

* Pathing

	* _-a_ Sets Pathing to Across Only
	* _-d_ Sets Pathing to Across & Diagonal

* Algorithm

	* _-a_ Sets A* Search as the algorithm to be used
	* _-d_ Sets Depth First Search as the algorithm to be used
	* _-b_ Sets Breadth First search as the algorithm to be used

* Board
	
	* _structure.txt_ must be a path to a board

* Defaults
	
	* The program is set to across and diagonal if the 2nd & 3rd command line argument is ommitted.
	* The program is set to A* search if the 3rd command line argument is ommitted.

* Note

	* The Board is the only command line argument that is required when running the program. 
	* To be able to specify the algorithm then all 4 command line arguments must be provided.  

## Creating a board

Inside the __src/Boards/__ directory there exists test boards that may be utilized for testing.<br />
Inside the __src/Boards/Invalid__ directory there exists test boards that are deemed to be invalid by the program.<br />

Here are a few guidelines in Creating a Board of your own...<br />

Create a _.txt_ file and fill it with the following characters:<br />

* ['S', 's'] : Start Node
* ['E', 'e'] : End Node
* '#' : Wall
* '_' : Open Path

### Rules

*  The Start Node and End Node Characters must only appear once in the board to be a valid board.<br />
* The Width of each row of the board must be symmetrical to be a valid board.<br />
* If there are characters present in the board that are not mentioned above then it will be an invalid board.<br />
* The Max Width of the Board is set to be 50, anything above that is considered invalid. This can be changed in <u>src/pathfind.h</u>.<br />
